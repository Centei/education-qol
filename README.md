# About Education QOL
Education QOL is a Firefox extension designed to help Schoology users track the latest updates to their grades in an easy to access manner.

Rather than having to click multiple times to view current grades, users can see all of their course grades at a quick glance.

## Future Additions

This is most likely the end for this extension as I will not be continuing further development. After becoming a web developer for the first time, it was fun at first, but I slowly lost interest in this project. At the end of the day, this was just an exercise to dip my toes into this unique space.
